// Cohesion not being calculated now


// We are not populating the invocation type (comp, piv, retr) when we redesign


// Implement redesign with rules
Initial:
     For each invocation:
            add the cluster before, if it wasnt already


For each invocation:
    check if it can be merged with the last invocation of that cluster (we have to store the last always)
    if it can:
       merge
       prune accesses 


(do this x times until no changes are done to the trace)


// Minimizar System Complexity ou FunctionalityComplexity ????
